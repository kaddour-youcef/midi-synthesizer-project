# midi-synthesizer-project
In this project I'm converting a synthesizer keyboard " Casio CTK-50" that you can buy 20$ on eBay, into a fully functional MIDI keyboard that you can use with midi music software like FL studio.... this using only an Arduino nano and 2 shift register 74hc595

- first you'll need to make the circuite following the schematics.
- you'll need to map the keyboard wires from the synthesizer main board
- on the arduino load the code 
- install a serial-midi bridge on the computer like " hairless midis-erial"
- remap the notes 
- enjoy a 2000$ keyboard for 20$
